# Orereo-Time
First unity project during Round 0 of Building Virtual Worlds course at Carnegie Mellon University Entertainment Technology Center, used as a gold spike tech check for all programmers in the course, in which I chose the arcade game Burger Time to remake into Orereo Time (double stuffed oreo)
Utilized Cinemachine.
